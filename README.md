🧠 How It Works

Create Post
Users can input a title and content, then save it as a post.

Edit Post
Existing posts can be updated using the edit option.

Delete Post
Posts can be removed from the app and from localStorage.

Persistence
All posts are saved in localStorage, so they remain even after the page is refreshed.
